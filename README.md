# minishell

> Thanks to Minishell, we were able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when Windows didnâ€™t exist.

The first bigger project in the 42 curriculum: **recoding our own little bash**. A program capable of parsing a prompt and launching executables with arguments, along with a few built-in functions.

MiniShell introduces us to the world of shells. It provides a convenient text interface to interact with the system. Shells might seem very easy to understand but have very specific and defined behaviour in almost every single case, most of which will need to be handled properly.

The output is still far from the original shell - especially because of the Hotfix period at the end of the project, but comes pretty close.

Thanks [mvomiero](https://github.com/mvomiero) for the collaboration on this project!

## Learning goals
- how does the concept of `Lexer` -> `Parser` -> `Executor` work
- how do I structure a bigger project to work on it in a team
- how is a shell set-up and how does it exactly work
- using known patterns such as _exit status_ in a bigger project
- And of course **how to collaborate** on a project and split workload in an efficient way!

Core features of our shell are:
- **_as simple as it is: the same as bash :-P_**
- search and launch executables (with relative and absolute path)
- working history
- handle quotes and $ (dollar sign)
- redirections (<, >, <<, >>)
- pipes
- environment variables
- `ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D` and `ctrl-\`
- builtins such as echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit
- not crashing in any scenarios - sounds trivial, I know
_Sure, it's not a full-grown shell, but pretty close. So please bare some abstractions in the implementation._

Allowed external functions / libraries:
- readline, rl_clear_history, rl_on_new_line, rl_replace_line, rl_redisplay, add_history, printf, malloc, free, write, access, open, read, close, fork, wait, waitpid, wait3, wait4, signal, sigaction, sigemptyset, sigaddset, kill, exit, getcwd, chdir, stat, lstat, fstat, unlink, execve, dup, dup2, pipe, opendir, readdir, closedir, strerror, perror, isatty, ttyname, ttyslot, ioctl, getenv, tcsetattr, tcgetattr, tgetent, tgetflag, tgetnum, tgetstr, tgoto, tputs
- Libft - own library with basic functions such as calloc, strncpm, etc. (see submodule)

_As usual: All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed. No leaks
will be tolerated._

# Usage
*Note that the program is written with Linux. Other operating systems were not tested.*

## Installing and Compiling
1) Clone the repository and its submodule by ``` git clone --recursive <project SSH/URL> ```
2) direct to the cloned folder ```cd <folder_name>```
3) ```make``` (automatically compiles the Libft)

## Execution
Simply run the minishell without arguments:
* Example: `./minishell`
